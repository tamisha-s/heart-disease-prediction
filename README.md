# Heart Disease Prediction with the UCI Dataset
## Implementing Machine Learning Approaches

Project Brief: Exploring classification models to detect heart disease using the UCI dataset

In this project, I will document my learnings as I go through the process of moving from solely theory to practical implementation.

I'm pretty excited so let's go ahead!
